    // 1. want to be able to scroll main highlighted object back and forward through history trail
    // 2. want to be able to play with time - maybe it's fine if we can just get this as a package that runs on a seeker, that will stop
    // coming to a stationary target ...
    // 3. want to be able to rotate the triangle
    // 4. to be able to adjust the position of the history path based on changing some parameters e.g. time to target etc. <-- this would be lovely but not practical???????? need a series of time slices ... and to calculate positions based on parameters for given time slice ...

    // so either I want a print out of the instantenous 10 velocities <-- seems like this might help resolve question better ...
    // or I want to dynamically change the number of history items --- no that sounds wrong ...

    // so I've got the history items printed out, and I've also got something similar in a spreadsheet.

    // looking at it feels like it confirms to me that the time to target effects the point at which the kinematic arrival drops
    // below the max speed, and we start to see deceleration, but the key influence on the deceleration appears to be the decreasing
    // distance to the target, and timeToTarget is a constant modifier on that.

    // However there is an interaction in that once we drop below the max speed the rate at which we approach the target slows down, 
    // which effectively leads to a stronger breaking effect ... and we get the same thing whether we have a max speed or not
    // time to target is controlling how long it takes to get to the target - by reducing the magnitude of the velocity at each step
    // it further reduces the magnitude of the velocity at the next step because the character has not moved as close to the target
    // as they would without the timeToTarget penalty, so on the next step the timeToTarget penalty is now penalizing something
    // smaller than would have been the case if it were not there in the first place, i.e. it has a cumulative effect

    // so key thing is to try this with dynamic systems

    // also think about how to have a control to adjust the positions, values of the history elements ...
